Execute the following steps to upload the code to your ESP32

Step 1: Connect the Oled screen to your ESP32
You can find the instruction how to connect the oled screen to your ESP32 in the related video on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bloxylabs "YouTube") channel.  

Step 2: Create a OpenWeather API and get your location code
Go to the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org "OpenWeather") website. Create a acoount and retrieve you API key from the user menu. Then search for the weather at your location. When the weather at your location is retrieved, just copy the code from your address bar. You need your api key and location code in step 5.

- ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
- Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
- Adafruit SSD1306 by Adafruit
- NTPClient by Fabrice Weinberg or NTPClient_Generic by Fabrice Weinberg
